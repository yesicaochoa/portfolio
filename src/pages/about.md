With more than a decade in the Design field, and 5 years in UX/Product Design, I've worked for startups, agencies and software companies collaborating with amazing experts from different industries such as healthcare, education, govtech, AI, fintech, e-commerce, blockchain and sustainability. I'm also Certified Scrum Product Owner® (CSPO®), from Scrum Alliance®.

Prior to this, my background stems from the visual and scenic arts where I worked with animation, mapping and videoart for theatre directors, musicians, performers, and art galleries from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, UK and Greece.
